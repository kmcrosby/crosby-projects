abstract: Advancing the precision of low-gravity liquid propellant mass gauging is a roadmap challenge for NASA and a significant obstacle to expanding human presence in space. We report flight test data for an implementation of a low-gravity liquid propellant mass gauging technology that is both non-invasive and propellant agnostic. The TRIO payload experiment flew twice on the Blue Origin New Shepard suborbital rocket and validated computational models of liquid distribution in microgravity at three different fill levels. The Propellant Refueling and On-orbit Transfer Operations (PROTO) payload experiment also flew twice on New Shepard and acquired mass gauging data before, during, and after a tank drain and fill that simulated in-space propellant transfers. Propellant volume estimates were derived at 1 Hz using the Modal Propellant Gauging (MPG) system. Analytical, semi-empirical, and finite element (FE) model results for predicted mode frequencies are compared to flight data for mode frequencies across a range of fill levels during the simulated propellant transfer. Flight (0-g), ground (1-g) and FEM mode frequencies for both 0- and 1-g are well-predicted by the semi-empirical models for frequency dependence on tank fill level.
