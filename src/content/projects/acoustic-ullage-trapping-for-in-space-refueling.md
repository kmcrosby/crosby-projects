The Microgravity Acoustic Ullage Trapping Technology is a flight demonstration experiment to show the ability to nucleate a secondary ullage from dissolved pressurant gases in a liquid fuel using phased array acoustic excitation. Pressurant gas phase is desaturated, evolved and trapped by our phased array of ultrasonic transducers.
